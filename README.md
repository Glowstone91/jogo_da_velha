🧠 Game Logic

The game uses a 3x3 matrix to represent the board:

let table = [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
];

Where:

0 = empty
1 = X
2 = O

Win detection is based on:

Rows
Columns
Diagonals
🎯 How to Play
Open the index.html file or access the live demo
Click on Player vs Player
Click on any cell on the board
Players alternate between X and O
The game ends when someone wins
